# Bare Minimum React App Boilerplate

My own attempt at creating a React development environment.

## Intall

```bash
git clone https://github.com/applefreak/react-app-boilerplate.git
cd react-app-boilerplate
yarn install
```

*Note*: If you want to start a project using this as the starting point, just remove `.git` folder and do `git init` to initialize your own Git repo!

## Usage

`./src` is where all your React app lives `index.js` is the entry point.

`./public/index.html` is where your browser will open the index page.

Feel free to modify these structures to suit your needs, there's no one way to do stuff!

## Why

Why not? *Lol*.

But seriously I just want a bare minimum development environment. I don't need all the fancy features of, say, [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## What's Included

I use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), because it's what the cool kids use.

Go check `package.json` yourself! But basically these:

**devDependencies**: `babel`

**dependencies**: `react`, `react-dom`
